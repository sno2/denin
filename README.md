ðŸ¦• A simple wrapper for deno's API ðŸ¦•

## Why?

Deno has a super simple API, this is a super simple wrapper to complement it.
Using denin takes away some of the repetitiveness of requesting data from it,
nothing more, nothing less.

## Goal

To be as simple as possible. There's no need to create a client and handle it,
it's just as easy as using `fetch`, maybe even easier.

## Docs

As with [rustin] I'll point you to the [docs]. There's a much nicer layout,
examples, and proper styling.
